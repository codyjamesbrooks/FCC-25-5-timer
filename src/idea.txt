Ok so I had an idea, But I don't have enough time to implament it. 
So I am going to type out notes and steps for the plan. 
Currently I have:
    App = Class Component 
      - BreakSession Set = Class Component
        - Two Divs allowing for setting of state vars break and session
      - CountDownTimer = Class Component
        - Two Divs one for the timer display with a Dynamically rendered label
          and the other with some timer controls. 

I am going to restructure everything to look like this. 
    App = Class Component 
        - State Variables: break, session, timerRunningFlag, lableValue
      <BreakSessionSet /> = Class Component
        - Two Divs allowing for setting of state vars break and session
      <label>Dynamically rendered label</label>
      <TimerDisplay /> = Functional component.
        - Rerender every second using setInterval. Triped into running using timerRunningFlag
        - set up similar to tick() function on 'https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html' 
      <TimerControsl> = Class Component 
        - Set up pretty similar as before. just strip out the display element.
